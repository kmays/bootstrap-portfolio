				 Hello, my name is Kyle. I live in the bay area, where I was born and raised in the Napa Valley.<br>
				 I'm a full-stack developer and currently working as a freelancer in all aspects of development.<br>
				 My journey into web development began with my education at UC Davis, where I earned my bachelor's degree in Science and Technology Studies.<br>
				 Following a stint of working at wine lab as a tech, I took my next step to furthering my web development skills by attending UC Berkeley Extension's Coding Bootcamp.<br> 
				 My focus and passion is working with big data helping organizations answer big questions to accelerate their insights and efficiency.<br>
				 <br>
				 Outside of work I enjoy painting, finding new trails to hike, and drinking coffee while listening to a podcast.<br>
				<br>
